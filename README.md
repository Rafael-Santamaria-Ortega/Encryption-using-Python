# Encryption-with-Python

This code is meant to encrypt and decrypt basic data using asymmetric encryption, Python and the Linux Command Line. This means that it leverages Python encryption capabilities in a Linux OS, and uses a relatively secure method of encryption that relies on a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Thus, only the intended recipient can decrypt the message encrypted with the shared public key, as they are intrinsically related.

### NOTE: I also provide a version of the full code adapted for Windows OS
